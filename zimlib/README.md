zimlib
------

The `zimlib` library is the standard implementation of the ZIM
specification.  It is a library which implements read and write
methods for ZIM files.

Use the zimlib in your own software --- for example, reader
applications --- to make them ZIM-capable without the need having to
dig too much into the ZIM file format.

To build:
```
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
```

The `zimlib` library is released under the GPLv2 license
terms.
