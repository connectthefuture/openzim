ZIMReader in Java
=================

This is a port of the ZIMReader in Java. One
of the aims of this project is to enable mobile
users developing on Android, J2ME and other
platforms to use ZIM files and build offline
Wikipedia readers.

I'll soon add a javadoc, in the mean time
you can go through the comments that I have
provided in the source code. Also, try running
the example ZIMTest.java.

This code was built on Java 1.6 and has not
been tested on previous versions. However, I'll
do that soon on previous ones as well. In the
next release, I intend to provide an Ant file.

If you find any bugs, please report them to
<aruneshmathur1990  at  gmail.com> or visit the
IRC channel #openzim on Freenode and ping
'gremmachook'.

This library is licensed under the LGPL v3.0
license. However, I understand that sometimes
licensing can be a problem for you. I would be
happy to provide a alternate lesser permissive
license if the need be.

Found this library useful? Drop in a mail, I
love to hear feedback.

Before this ends, I'd like to thank Lasse Collin
<Lasse.collin at tukaani.org>, who maintains the
Tukaani project, for his port of XZ in Java,
without which it wouldn't have been possible for
me to write this library.
